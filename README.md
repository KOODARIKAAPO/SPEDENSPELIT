# SPEDENSPELIT
A school projekt. A reactionspeed game. 
In short. This is an arduino projekt written in c and c++. The game generates random numbers between 0-3. It then lights up the corresponding led light to indicate what button the player has to press. After 10 succsesfull button presses the game speeds up. We have added an highscore functionality and a buzzer that makes sound for each button press. There are also simple lightshows at gamestart, highscore, and every time the game speeds up.
